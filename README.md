Project: Data Cleaning and Translation for Chinese Car Owners Dataset
Overview
This script is designed to clean, translate, and process a CSV dataset of car owners in China. It handles various tasks such as translating column headers from Chinese to English, formatting the headers, removing invalid data (e.g., invalid emails), and separating the cleaned data from the discarded (garbage) data.

Features:
Translation: Column headers are automatically translated from Chinese to English using Google Translate.
Header Formatting: Translated headers are formatted by replacing spaces with underscores (_) and converting all characters to lowercase.
Data Cleaning:
Removes duplicate rows.
Replaces empty cells with NaN and drops rows where all columns have NaN values.
Validates email addresses using regex and moves invalid email rows to a separate "garbage" dataset.
Column Removal: Certain columns (such as personal information like gender, address, etc.) are removed and stored in a separate "garbage" dataset.
Chunk Processing: The dataset is split into four chunks, each processed separately.
Final Output: Cleaned and garbage data are saved as separate CSV files (merged_cleaned_data.csv and merged_garbage_data.csv).
Prerequisites
Before running this script in Google Colab or a similar environment, ensure the following libraries are installed:

pandas
numpy
re (Regular Expressions)
googletrans (for translation)
To install the necessary libraries, run the following command in Colab:

python
Copy code
!pip install pandas numpy googletrans==4.0.0-rc1
How to Run
Upload the CSV file: Upload the CSV file (760k-Car-Owners-Nationwide-China-csv-2020.csv) containing the car owners' data to your Google Colab environment.

Adjust File Path: The script assumes that the file is uploaded to /content/760k-Car-Owners-Nationwide-China-csv-2020.csv. If the file path differs, update the file_path variable to match your file's location.

Run the Script: Copy and paste the script into a Colab cell and run it. The script will:

Translate and format the column headers.
Clean the data and remove unnecessary columns.
Validate email addresses.
Split the data into chunks, clean each chunk, and handle invalid data.
Save the final cleaned dataset and the garbage dataset into two separate CSV files.
Download Processed Files: After execution, the script will automatically trigger the download of the cleaned data and the garbage data files (merged_cleaned_data.csv and merged_garbage_data.csv).

Key Functions
clean_data(df): Cleans the data by removing duplicates, replacing empty cells with NaN, and dropping rows with all NaN values.

is_valid_email(email): Uses regular expressions to validate email addresses. Invalid emails are discarded into the garbage dataset.

Files
Input File:
760k-Car-Owners-Nationwide-China-csv-2020.csv
Output Files:
merged_cleaned_data.csv: Contains all valid, cleaned data.
merged_garbage_data.csv: Contains removed columns and rows with invalid data (such as invalid emails).
List of Columns Moved to Garbage
The following columns are removed from the cleaned dataset and placed in the garbage file:

gender
province
city
address
post_code
industry
monthly_salary
marriage
educate
brand
car
model
configuration
color
Example Output
merged_cleaned_data.csv: This file contains all the cleaned and validated data without personal information columns and invalid email rows.

merged_garbage_data.csv: This file contains all discarded columns and rows, including invalid email addresses and personal information columns.

Known Limitations
Google Translate API: The accuracy of column header translations depends on Google Translate.
Email Validation: The script only checks for format validity in email addresses and does not verify the existence of the email.
